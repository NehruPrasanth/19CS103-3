    <p> <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007, with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.[13] The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the BCCI were not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[14] To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in their own domestic tournaments and also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which was considered a rebel league by the board<br><br>
    </p>
    <p><h1>PLAYER ACQUISITION SQUAD COMPOSITION AND SALARIES</h1>
    <b>1.The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.<br></b>
    <b>2.Salary cap of the entire squad must not exceed ₹850 million (US$12 million).<br></b>
    <b>3.Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played first-class or List A cricket.<br></b>

    <p> <h1>MATCH RULES</h1>
        IPL games utilise television timeouts and hence there is no time limit in which teams must complete their innings. However, a penalty may be imposed if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege. Each team is given a two-and-a-half-minute "strategic timeout" during each innings; one must be taken by the bowling team between the ends of the 6th and 9th overs, and one by the batting team between the ends of the 13th and 16th overs.[35]

        Since the 2018 season, the Umpire Decision Review System is being used in all IPL matches, allowing each team one chance to review an on-field umpire's decision per innings.
    </p>
    <p><h1>PRIZE MONEY</h1>
        The 2019 season of the IPL offered a total prize money of ₹500 million (US$7.0 million), with the winning team netting ₹200 million (US$2.8 million). The first and second runners up received ₹125 million (US$1.8 million) and ₹87.5 million (US$1.2 million), respectively, with the fourth placed team also winning ₹87.5 million (US$1.2 million).[37] The other teams are not awarded any prize money. The IPL rules mandate that half of the prize money must be distributed among the players.
    </p>
    <p><h1>ORANGE CAP</h1>
        The Orange Cap is awarded to the top run-scorer in the IPL during a season. It is an ongoing competition with the leader wearing the cap throughout the tournament until the final game, with the eventual winner keeping the cap for the season.
    </p>
    <p><h1>PURPLE CAP</h1>
        The Purple Cap is awarded to the top wicket-taker in the IPL during a season. It is an ongoing competition with the leader wearing the cap throughout the tournament until the final game, with the eventual winner keeping the cap for the season.
    </p>
    <p><h1>MOST VALUABLE PLAYER</h1>
        The award was called the "man of the tournament" till the 2012 season. The IPL introduced the Most Valuable Player rating system in 2013, the leader of which would be named the "Most Valuable Player" at the end of the season.
